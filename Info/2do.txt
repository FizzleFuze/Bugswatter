    - squish dem bugs
        - colonists gaining incompatible traits (from storybits?) (unconfirmed)
        - services unavailable messages (already fixed?)
        - water (terraforming) parameter not increasing (unconfirmed, unable to replicate)


Notes:
    - The original StoryBitTrigger function stops additional categories from being checked, so in a situation where a category is being checked but no StoryBits are activated, none of the other story
     bits will be activated either. Potentially, you get in a situation where no story bits are ever activated. Updated to use the return value from the try function.
        - wtf is this?!  helps with lag I suppose... maybe write a check in to the Try function just before sleeping... also "activated" seems to do nothing.
        elseif msg == "StoryBitTick" and 0 <= #category.storybit_states then
                                local sleep_time = const.StoryBits.TickDuration / 10 / #category.storybit_states
                                CreateGameTimeThread(function()
                                    category:TryActivateStoryBit(map_id, object, Clamp(sleep_time, 1, 10))
                                end)
